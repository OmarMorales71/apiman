                Welcome to Scheer PAS API Management, the component that helps you to manage your APIs.
                Use API Management to publish your APIs and make them available to your clients (consumers) in a secure,
                scalable, and governable way. API Management enables API developers to centralize control and analysis of
                their APIs. It also provides a central location for client developers to find and consume available APIs.

                All APIs, clients, plans and users must be managed within the context of an organization. Users can be
                members of multiple organizations at the same time owning different roles in each organization: you can
                be
                an organization owner in one organization and an editor in another. Memberships for each organization
                can
                be easily managed in the Organization tab.

                An API is also known as a "service", meaning anything that can be invoked remotely by some sort of
                client. API Management simply provides a way to turn unmanaged (raw) back-end APIs into "managed" APIs
                by attaching policies to them.
                Two different states of APIs can be managed in the API Management: Public APIs are available to any
                invoker at a static endpoint. Private APIs are only accessible for your clients (consumers). You can
                create new APIs manually or easily import them from the API Catalog.

                The client is the consumer of the API. The client represents a piece of software that needs to consume
                managed APIs offered through the API Management.
                Each client can consume multiple APIs within the API Management, therefore a contract is created between
                an API and a client over a plan. As with an API or a plan, you can also add policies to a client. If you
                created a contract, you will get an API-Key to invoke the API.
