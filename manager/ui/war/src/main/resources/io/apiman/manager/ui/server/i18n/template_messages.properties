api-contracts=API Contracts
api-contracts-help=Here is a list of all contracts between all clients and this API. This provides a list of all clients that may potentially consume this API.
api-def.choose-type.title=Choose a type...
api-def=API Definition
api-def-explanation=It is optional to provide definition information about your API in the form of a Swagger API definition file. Adding a definition file will allow consumers to better understand how to use your API. Copy/paste or drag and drop your Swagger API definition into the text area below.
api-definition=API Definition
api-definition-label=API Definition:
api-delete-modal-confirmation-description= This action CANNOT be undone. This will permanently delete the API, including all of its versions, their policies, contracts, and change logs. Please back up the project if you think you may want to roll back the changes, as this action is irrevocable.
api-delete-modal-confirmation-warning=Important Note!
api-details=API Details
api-dialog-explanation=You have to provide the appropriate API Key with each request to invoke the managed API for this API contract successfully. The API Key can be provided by sending it as an HTTP Request Header named X-API-Key. You can also send it as a URL query parameter.
api-endpoint-label=API Endpoint:
api-impl.choose-content-type.placeholder=Choose a content type...
api-impl.choose-type.placeholder=Choose a type...
api-impl.mtsl-info=When using MTLS/Two-Way-SSL you must configure the relevant settings globally in the apiman.properties file. Please refer to the Installation Guide for details.
api-impl.parse-payload-info=Note that enabling this option may result in additional performance overhead. However, this feature is sometimes required for certain policies to work (in particular many SOAP policies).
api-impl=API Implementation
api-impl-explanation=Provide details about the backend API implementation so that the API gateway can successfully proxy API requests. Please include any security you wish to enable between the API gateway and the backend API.
api-impl-gateway-explanation=There are multiple API gateways configured - you'll need to tell us which one you want to use for this API.
api-impl-new-gateway-explanation=An API gateway has been added since this API was created. The new gateway has been selected for you - all you need to do is click Save below to make it stick.
api-impl-no-gateways-explanation=There are no API gateways configured. For this reason you will not be able to complete the configuration of your API. Please contact your administrator - at least one API gateway must be configured!

api-metrics.show-metrics-for=metrics data for the
api-metrics=API Metrics
api-metrics-explanation=Now that this API is published to the gateway, it may be consumed by API clients. Use this tab to view basic metrics/analytics for the API.
api-modified.title=The API has been modified since it was last published!
api-modified=Modified
api-name=API Name
api-overview.activity-description=The Change Log tab shows a history of all the changes made to the API. Essentially this is an audit log.
api-overview.api-description=Use the API details to modify the metadata, plans and policies for the API. There is no need to follow the tabs in order, but you will need to fill out a minimum amount of data before the API can be published to the gateway. In particular, the Implementation and Plans tabs are important.
api-overview.contracts-description=The Contracts tab shows all of the registered consumers of the API. If the API is marked as Public, this tab will likely be empty.
api-overview.definition-description=The Definition tab allows you to configure an optional API definition document for your API. An API definition is a detailed description of the capabilities of your API (operation names, http verbs, data models). You can add a Swagger spec document as your API definition.
api-overview.endpoint-description=The Endpoint tab will show you information about how to invoke the API once it is published to the API gateway.
api-overview.impl-description=The Implementation tab is where you go to configure the details of the real API being managed. This is where you tell the gateway where the API is, so that we can actually invoke it at runtime.
api-overview.metrics-description=The Metrics tab contains basic analytic information for the API. Use this tab to monitor the usage of the API.
api-overview.plans-description=The Plans tab is used to configure which plans (defined in the organization) are available when a client wishes to create an API contract with this API. Optionally, an API can also be marked as Public. In that case, no API contract is required and the API can be invoked without sending an API Key.
api-overview.policies-description=The Policies tab is where API-level policies can be configured. These policies should be enforced for all requests to the API, regardless of which user, client, or plan is being used.
api-plans.no-locked-plans-found=No locked plans were found in the organization. Please create and lock at least one plan before attempting to configure them here. Or make your APIs Public using the checkbox above.
api-policies=API Policies
api-policies-help=Here is a list of all policies defined for this API. These policies will be applied to all invocations of this API by any client, regardless of the plan used in its contract.

dash.apis-description=An API is also known as a service, meaning anything that can be invoked remotely by some sort of client. API Management simply provides a way to turn unmanaged (raw) backend APIs into managed APIs by attaching policies to them. Two different states of APIs can be managed in the API Management: Public APIs are available to any invoker at a static endpoint. Private APIs are only accessible for your clients (consumers). You can create new APIs manually or easily import them from the API Catalog.
dash.clients-description=The client is the consumer of the API. The client represents a piece of software that needs to consume managed APIs offered through the API Management. Each client can consume multiple APIs within the API Management, therefore a contract is created between an API and a client over a plan. Policies can be added to the client in the same way as for plans and APIs. If you created a contract, you will get an API Key to invoke the API.
dash.orgs-description=All APIs, clients, plans and users must be managed within the context of an organization. Users can be members of multiple organizations at the same time owning different roles in each organization: you can be an organization owner in one organization and an editor in another. Memberships for each organization can be easily managed in the Organization tab.
dash.page-description=Welcome to Scheer PAS API Management, the component that helps you to manage your APIs. Use API Management to publish your APIs and make them available to your clients (consumers) in a secure, scalable, and governable way. API Management enables API developers to centralize control and analysis of their APIs. It also provides a central location for client developers to find and consume available APIs.
